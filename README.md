# Description

This is a program that converts images into low poly art. It works using logic and code taken from [here](https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/lowpoly), alongside a lot of my own tweaks (mainly to do with image processing and plotting). I'm trying to get this to work properly with SVGs, but matplotlib currently saves SVGs weirdly so whenever I do there ends up being overlap, which sucks because stuff like this is perfect for SVGs. 

To run it yourself just edit the main function to your preference. I might write about what sigma means later, but for now it's 3:30am and I'm tired, so I won't.
